# Human Driver Responses to Autonomous Vehicles

## Overview

This project studies how human drivers respond differently to autonomous vehicles (AVs) compared to other human-driven vehicles. We examine whether and how the presence of AVs on the road alters the behavior, risk-taking, and decision-making of surrounding human drivers.

## Research Questions

- Do human drivers behave differently (e.g., following distance, lane-changing, speed) when interacting with AVs versus human-driven vehicles?
- Are behavioral responses heterogeneous across driver demographics, experience, or familiarity with AV technology?
- What are the safety and efficiency implications of human–AV interaction patterns?
